- Idea brainstorming
- Creative writing assistance

## Framework Examples

### LangChain
- Tool-augmented agents with memory
- Sequential and parallel task execution
- Custom tool creation patterns
- Agent chain composition

### AutoGPT
- Autonomous goal-seeking behavior
- Self-directed task breakdown
- Internet search integration
- File system operations

### CrewAI
- Multi-agent collaboration
- Role-based agent specialization
- Task delegation patterns
- Shared memory and communication

### OpenAI Assistants API
- Built-in tool support (code interpreter, retrieval)
- Thread-based conversation management
- File handling and analysis
- Function calling patterns

## Common Design Patterns

### 1. ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)
- Interleave reasoning and action steps
- Document thought process explicitly
- Use observations to update reasoning
- Iterate until goal achieved

### 2. Plan-Execute-Review
- Create detailed plan before acting
- Execute plan step by step
- Review results and adjust plan
- Iterate for complex tasks

### 3. Hierarchical Task Decomposition
- Break complex tasks into subtasks
- Assign subtasks to specialized agents
- Aggregate results
- Handle dependencies between subtasks

### 4. Memory-Augmented Agents
- Short-term memory (conversation context)
- Long-term memory (knowledge base)
- Working memory (intermediate results)
- External memory (vector databases)

## Tool Integration Patterns

### Search and Retrieval
- Web search APIs (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo)
- Vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, ChromaDB)
- Document stores (Elasticsearch, MongoDB)
- Knowledge graphs (Neo4j, RDF stores)

### Code Execution
- Python REPL integration
- Jupyter notebook execution
- Sandboxed code runners
- CI/CD integration

### Communication
- Email (SMTP, Gmail API)
- Messaging (Slack, Discord, Teams)
- Social media (Twitter, LinkedIn APIs)
- SMS and phone calls

### File Operations
- Local file system access
- Cloud storage (S3, Drive, Dropbox)
- Document parsing (PDF, Word, Excel)
- Image and video processing

## Workspace Applications

### Agent Templates
- Use patterns from this collection for common tasks
- Adapt multi-agent examples for workspace automation
- Implement tool integration patterns for MCP servers

### Inspiration for Custom Agents
- Document analysis agent for knowledge base
- Repository health monitoring agent (Librarian)
- Convention compliance checker
- Automated testing and validation agents

### Best Practices to Adopt
- Explicit memory management
- Tool abstraction layers
- Error handling and retry logic
- User confirmation for destructive actions

## Key Takeaways

1. **Specialization**: Narrow agents perform better than general-purpose ones
2. **Tool Use**: Real-world impact requires external tool integration
3. **Memory**: Persistent memory essential for continuity
4. **Collaboration**: Multi-agent systems solve complex problems
5. **Human-in-Loop**: Critical actions should require confirmation
